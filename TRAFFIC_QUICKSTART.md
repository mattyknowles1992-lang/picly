   🧵 I spent 6 months building an AI image generator
   
   Here's what I learned about creating perfect prompts 
   (with examples) →
   
   1/ Most AI prompts are basic
   "A dog" gets you... a dog
   
   But professional prompts get STUNNING results
   
   Here's the difference: [image comparison]
   
   2/ The secret: SPECIFIC technical details
   
   Instead of "portrait"
   Use "Portrait, Hasselblad H6D camera, Rembrandt lighting, 
   bokeh depth of field, 8K RAW"
   
   Example: [amazing portrait]
   
   [Continue for 10 tweets]
   
   10/ Want to try these prompts?
